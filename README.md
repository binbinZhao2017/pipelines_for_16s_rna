# pipelines_for_16s_rna
This is the pipeline I built recently for the project GV009.
The project is to explore the 16s RNA sequencing data of tumor mice model treated with expected drugs.
There are two groups(gv009 and vehicle), three dosages(0mpk, 30mpk and 60mpk) and three drug batchs(201902, 201905, 201906) for this project. The aim of the analysis is to compare the treatment of different dosages of gv009 on LLC tumor mice model on the drug batch basis. The analysis methods are mainly Lefse and sPLS-DA.

Note: 1. The html file, generated by the Rmd file, is the analysis report and can open with browser.
      2. The R script file is under folder src.
